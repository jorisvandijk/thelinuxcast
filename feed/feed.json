      "title": "My Return to Android",
      "content_html": "<p>A few months ago, I talked about how I switched to iOS after having used Android for almost 3 years. As I said then, that switch was one that I usually do every 3 years or so, if only to see what the other main platform has come up with.</p>\n<p>For the last few months, I've been using an iPhone 11 Pro Max, and to be honest, I love the hardware but I can't stand iOS. It's odd because I used to love iOS. The apps for Apple's platform have always been superior (and I still feel that way for some apps), and their ability to deliver updates to so many of their devices immediately is both impressive and awesome for the user. I always like new things and being able to install the latest update right from Apple without having to wait for a carrier to do it just makes me happy.</p>\n<p>But iOS itself is horrible. The notifications are even worse than they were the last time I spent any time on the platform and I found myself so constrained with moving around that the experience wasn't enjoyable.</p>\n<p>So let me break this down a bit.</p>\n<h2>Notifications on iOS</h2>\n<p>The biggest issue is that I love actionable notifications. And while iOS has these, they are only actionable when they appear. Once they disappear into your notification shade, you can't do anything but open the app or dismiss them. Add on top of that that there is no way for you to know a notification came in after it has appeared on your screen unless you see it on your lock screen, and the notification system is useless.</p>\n<p>Android is better. You can interact with the notifications in many ways, even from the notification shade, and there's an icon at the top of the screen indicating what notifications you have. Way better. Not that Android doesn't have its issues when it comes to notifications. I don't care for how there is a popup when the notification comes in. At least it is smaller than it used to be. I still do miss the scrolling notifications in the notification bar that used to be on Android.</p>\n<p>I don't understand why Apple can't do notifications right. They are such an important part of a mobile operating system, you'd think that they could get it right after over a decade of trying. But no.</p>\n<p>It honestly drove me crazy. While I don't care if I miss a notification from a game or something, missing notifications from messaging clients are annoying AF. And then not being able to go into the notification shade and respond from there is just bad design, especially when we know it can be done.</p>\n<h2>My Icons</h2>\n<p>I knew going in that I wasn't going to be able to easily make my home screen the way I wanted it. That was fine. Mainly because I found myself recreating the iOS grid on Android so often I didn't think I'd miss the ability to put icons wherever I damn well please</p>\n<p>But I did.</p>\n<p>I should have realized with my love of ricing, that I'd miss the ability to customize my phone, but I didn't think it would be that bad.</p>\n<p>On top of that, there is the lack of customization elsewhere that felt constraining. Things like being able to add things to the share sheet were just annoying.</p>\n<p>I lived with it, but it was always a constant thing in the back of my mind.</p>\n<h2>Siri is the worst</h2>\n<p>I always knew that Siri was behind Google Assistant in every way that matters. I just didn't think it was so far behind. Being able to do something simple like repeat a track or lower the volume while I'm in the shower is something I got used to with Android. You can't do that with Siri, or at least you can't do it easily.</p>\n<p>And sometimes the responses from Siri when asking a simple question were just dumb. And the number of times she just dumps you into a Google search is ridiculous. If all I wanted to do was search Google, I'd do that. The point of these assistants is to avoid having to do that directly and to be a bit hands-free about the whole thing. Siri doesn't get that? I don't know what Apple is doing.</p>\n<p>Sometimes I wonder if Apple even uses its own products. They don't seem to because if they did, their products would be better. Notifications would get fixed, and Siri would get better. But they don't. Ever. It's not as if this is a new problem, this has been the case for almost a decade when it comes to Siri and even longer when it comes to the notification problem.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I don't do all this bitching without knowing that Android doesn't have its own problems. The phone I bought is a Samsung Galaxy S21+, and there are apps on there that cannot be deleted or disabled and are running all the time. This drives me insane. Knowing that there are apps on there that are running that I don't want to run is just so aggravating. And it is not as if I can do the custom ROM thing as Samsung is known to disable parts of the hardware if you do that. So I could install lineage or whatever, and I'd just end up with a half-working phone.</p>\n<p>I guess the bottom line is that both platforms are flawed. At the end of the day, however, the things about Android piss me off less than the lack of customizability and poor notifications do on iOS.</p>\n<p>I wish there was a Linux phone out there that could save me from this. And I'm sure that if I made the switch, I could use it. But there are apps and games that I like to use on my phone that just wouldn't be available on a Linux phone. Maybe I'd just use my Phone less or adapt to using the web versions of some of the apps that have that sort of thing available, I don't know. Maybe I should give it a try and see just how usable a Linux phone is.</p>\n<p>Hope everyone is having a great week.

      "title": "An Essay on YouTube Mental Health",
      "content_html": "<p>I've been creating videos now on YouTube since September 2020. While that doesn't seem like all that long, in that time I've created over 400 videos, had over 1,000,000 views, and I'm really close to 10,000 subscribers. So, I think that I am qualified enough to talk about some YouTube stuff.</p>\n<p>I call it stuff because talking about Mental Health is always uncomfortable. Nobody likes doing it, and nobody likes listening to it because it makes us all think about our own struggles with emotions and the everyday grind of life in the Real World.</p>\n<p>One of the problems I deal with outside of the YouTube world is motivation. It is something that has always been a problem for me. I joke a lot that I'm the laziest bastard this side of the Mississippi, but I really do have times where I just have no interest in doing anything. More times than I'd like to admit to, really.</p>\n<p>I say this because that laziness often peaks it head into the YouTube world as well. A lot. Pesky little bugger.</p>\n<p>Maintaining a YouTube channel that puts out a video almost every single day has definitely tested my ability to stay motivated. Add on top that this is <em>not</em> my job and it has been especially hard some days to even think about making a video.</p>\n<p>So, it is perhaps unsurprising, that there are certain aspects of being a 'YouTuber' that can make it even harder to continue on.</p>\n<p>The biggest thing is, obviously, views. There is no predicting what video will do really well and which one will flop. You can spend 4 days recording and editing a video and it will be a complete failure, while at the same time spend 15 minutes on a video and it will get 10,000 views.</p>\n<p>Even Mr. Beast can't predict the YouTube algorithm, though he definitely does a better job of it than almost anyone else. So, it's not surprising that I can't do a good job of it.</p>\n<p>The issue is that because of this unpredictability, there are times when you get two or three videos in a row that just flop. There's no reason why, they just do. Even if you thought that they'd do well, and are topics that you thought would be appealing to a lot of your audience, they just flop.</p>\n<p>And that brings us back to motivation.</p>\n<p>There is no feeling worse than signing into YouTube studio (the backend that YouTube provides for creators) and seeing that the video you uploaded an hour before is the 10th video in terms of views out of the last 10 you published. It gets even worse when you have days like this in a row, where no video seems to be good enough.</p>\n<p>Fighting through that is so, so hard. The voice in my head gets pissy, of course. &quot;Why the fuck do I make videos? Ungrateful little assholes.&quot; Not that it's anyone's fault. It's hard not to think that way. It's hard not to get greedy when things are going well, and just come to assume that things will continue to go well.</p>\n<p>There are no guarantees on YouTube. That's for sure.</p>\n<p>The constant worry of failure is ever present. If you see that dreaded 10/10 it is really hard not to think that it's <em>you</em> who has done something wrong. Have that happen for multiple days in a row and it is impossible to not to think about how your channel is dying and that all the work you've put in for years has been for nothing.</p>\n<p>The toll it takes is vast and something that is not talked about enough. Sure, creating content on YouTube is not a hard job. I never will say that. There are jobs out there that are dangerous, physically demanding, and more mentally taxing. However, just because YouTube Content Creator isn't something that Mike Rowe would do, doesn't mean it can't be a contributor to depression and stress.</p>\n<p>Since 2020, I've experienced this depression multiple times. Sometimes several times in the same day. The up and down nature of being able to constantly plug into real-time stats makes it really easy to see when something isn't going as well as you had hoped it would. And when that happens, feeling down about it is inevitable.</p>\n<p>I've tried multiple times to remove the studio app from my phone, prevent myself from visiting the website, all in the hopes that I won't become so attached to watching the views and subscribers go up and down and up and down. And I have gotten better. When I first really started getting views (I mean any at all. I was so happy when I started to get 10 views a video), I checked every 2-5 minutes. It was an obsession.</p>\n<p>Luckily, I don't do that now. I still check once and hour or so, and that's too often. (I do so more often right after a video has been published). But the need to look and see how things are going is strong and hard to fight against.</p>\n<p>Motivation. That's where I started off this little talk. And it's where I'll end. Maintaining motivation and having fun creating content are essential if you want to be successful on YouTube (no matter what measure of success you're using). Losing interest in what you're doing can be devastating and make you feel like you're a complete failure and that nothing you ever do will be good enough.</p>\n<p>Seeing constant statistics that tell you that you're latest videos have bombed just make you feel like you want to give up. Add on top of that the trolls and the meanness that exists in every content section, and it's no wonder that so many YouTubers give up after a year or so, no matter the success they've found.</p>\n<p>For me, the only thing I've found that works is to reset myself. To go and do a video that I want to do and that I don't give a damn how it does. Something exotic or so niche that nobody would ever watch it. But I do it anyways because it reminds me that I'm not doing this for the money or to be the next Mr. Beast. I started this because I thought it would be fun and I wanted to talk about Linux and Tech. Reminding myself of those reasons makes everything else not matter so much.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, YouTube is stressful. I have to constantly remind myself that if a couple videos don't do well, that it's okay and that the next one will be better. Hopefully. That hope that eventually you'll get out of your slump is just enough, most  days, to keep the motivation high enough to create another video.</p>\n<p>Some days.</p>\n<p>I hope everyone is having a great week.

      "title": "Audio Still Sucks on Linux",
      "content_html": "<p>On this past Sunday night (or a week ago Sunday if you’re not a patron), I had a huge plan. I was going to rice i3wm over and over again, creating several themes. It’s something I did for DWM and wanted (and still want) to do for i3 now that i3wm is my daily driver again.</p>\n<p>The problem is that once I got streaming, no one could hear me. And I was like what the F$#k? My audio had been working fine. Tyler and I had even done a podcast a few days before that and everything worked fine during that stream.</p>\n<p>The only thing that changed was that there was an update to pipewire on Arch.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Pipewire. That piece of crap.</p>\n<p>So, I did some trouble shooting, and found that for some reason, my input/output sources were going wonky. At least one was connecting and reconnecting randomly for no apparent reason. If it was just one source, I would have thought that it was that source going bad or needing to be rebooted. But it wasn’t. One time it was one source, the next it was another. It was effing odd.</p>\n<p>Add on top of that, OBS was trying to make my amp/dac an input device, even though it’s, like, totally not an input device. This is a problem I had with Pipewire once before on Arch, so obviously this is something that happens a lot.</p>\n<p>It is infuriating.</p>\n<p>So, I decided to hop. I moved away from Vanilla Arch and decided to go to MX Linux. I figure that I won’t have to deal with random updates that break crap on a Debian-based distro.</p>\n<p>Of course, it wouldn’t get past grub once I installed it. For f#$! sake.</p>\n<p>After hours of messing around, I was about this close  , from just saying eff my Linux career, eff the YouTube Channel, eff everything, I’m installing Windows.</p>\n<p>You think I’m kidding, but it’s true. I was so, so angry. Nothing was going right.</p>\n<p>In the end, I ended up back on Arco. Arco seems to always treat me right and I enjoy their community more than any other. I get everything set back up on my system, all my apps installed, all my files back on the HDD, and what happens?</p>\n<p>Same damn audio issue.</p>\n<p>Yeah.</p>\n<p>I did get it so that it will work, but for some reason, Pavucontrol/pulsemixer still wants to do some odd things. If I have it in my normal configuration, It wants to assigned my amp/dac to be an input device. But in OBS’s audio level indicator everything seems fine. If I go into pulsemixer/pavucontrol and change all my inputs to my Scarlet Solo, as it should be, then OBS thinks that the Desktop Audio (which is an Output) is actually a mono input. WTF?</p>\n<p>Linux audio sucks. And I’ve said this before, but Pipewire actually makes audio on Linux suck unless you’re getting into Jack or something. If you’re just a normal audio user, Pipewire is still broken. Linux is 31 years old. Audio should not still be a problem.</p>\n<p>Of course, I could uninstall pipewire. But it turns out doing that actually is harder than uninstalling snaps on Ubuntu. It’s tied into everything. And I mean everything. You have to remove like 20 packages, some of them essential, to get it to go away. It’s infuriating.</p>\n<p>Anyways, it has not been a great week on Linux for me. Here’s hoping that the audio works fine for the pod on Thursday. But I’m not going to hold my breath.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to see these blog posts a week early, you can support me on Patreon here.</p>\n<p>Matt</p>\n",

      "title": "I Like Flatpaks",
      "content_html": "<p>My love affair with the AUR is well documented. It's so bad I can't use anything that's not Arch-based on my main computer. Without the AUR, I just feel lost and without all of my lovely programs.</p>\n<p>(I'm really not without them, of course. The repos on Debian/Ubuntu/MX are great for the most part)</p>\n<p>Even with that love affair still going strong, I find myself enjoying Flatpaks more and more. Some of this is some recent problems with building some apps from the AUR. Honestly, the problems have surprised me because for years, the AUR has been mostly flawless for me. I don't think I've ever encountered a major problem prior to the last couple weeks.</p>\n<p>With those problems, I had to turn to other sources. I refuse to use Snaps. I can't stand them, and despite what @DistroTube says, I think it's perfectly fine for me to hate them. I don't like loopback devices cluttering my lsblk or a Snap directory permanently being placed in my $HOME directory.</p>\n<p>So, I chose Flatpaks. And, I have to say, it has been a surprisingly good experience so far. I'm using the Audacity, GIMP and OBS flatpaks so far. The Audacity one seems to be the only way to get a 3.0+ version of Audacity without building it on Arch. I know that it has telemetry and I really don't like it, but I have a ton of project files with the new .aup file format, and pre 3.0 Audacity can't handle those. (Thank you Audacium for getting me onto that format and then breaking so I can't build you.)</p>\n<p>By far the best experience is the OBS flatpak. I didn't know that the OBS package on Arch was so handicapped. Now I get access to chat panels and so much more, and it's awesome.</p>\n<p>While I'm sure that there are downsides to Flatpaks (themeing still seems to be a problem), I have enjoyed just being able to download an app without having to watch my terminal download a ton of dependencies, all of which add to my package count (not that that really matters, but it's something my brain notices). I also have enjoyed not having to wait for my computer to build the packages.</p>\n<p>The only real problem I have is that the classes for the Flatpaks are wrong. You can't go into sxhkd and assign a binding to gimp anymore, it has to be com.gimp.whatever and it's a mess. We've had classes for decades, can we please not come up with something else that is legitimately worse?</p>\n<p>The real question is, will this newfound interest in flatpaks enable me to move away from Arch Linux? After all, the primary feature that I love most about Arch is the AUR. If I no longer need it, does that mean I can go to something like, I don't know, Solus and be happy there? Something to think about I guess.</p>\n<p>Hope everyone has a nice week, even with all the idiocy that is going on in the world right now.</p>\n<p>If you'd like these blog posts a week early, you can support me on Patreon here.</p>\n<p>Matt</p>\n",

      "title": "I Bought The Apple Watch… And It Kind of Sucks",
      "content_html": "<p>In an effort to start to move around more and become more healthy, I decided that I would do the nerd thing and buy a gadget to keep track of health and fitness metrics. Because I switched to the iPhone - and from everything I read, Android watches suck - I decided I would pick up an Apple Watch.</p>\n<p>I’ve been using this thing now for a week, and I thought I’d write about my experiences so far.</p>\n<p>First, I have never really worn a watch for any length of time before, so getting used to it has been a chore. I am finally getting there, but every time the damn thing buzzes with a notification, I startle. It’s kind of entertaining to watch. LOL.</p>\n<p>But the main functionality that I bought it for has been disappointing. The biggest issue is that it is so inaccurate that it’s almost funny. The pedometer, for example, often states I have walked 10 miles during the day. Like, that’s not even possible. If it said a mile, I might have believed it, though I would have thought it was on the high side.</p>\n<p>I spend the vast majority of my day sitting in front of my computer, using vim. I don’t walk around nearly enough, and I really don’t think I walk 10 miles a day when most days I don’t even leave the damn house.</p>\n<p>I had so many hopes that it would be at least somewhat accurate. I wanted, and still plan to, move around more. I have the shittiest knees in the world (I’ve had multiple knee surgeries), so moving around is always hard. With the idea of having a step counter, I had hoped that it would form a little bit of motivation. With how inaccurate the Apple Watch is, I don’t know how well it will work.</p>\n<p>Though I will still try to use it, of course, it won’t be as useful as it could otherwise be.</p>\n<p>The other thing I really wanted was a reminder to stand up every so often. I usually get engrossed in my writing and work and forget to stand up as many times an hour as I should. So I thought that the Apple Watch would help with that. So far, I have been disappointed. It does count how many times you stand up, but only once an hour, and it will only remind you if you’re close to not meeting your daily goal. There might be something I’m missing here, but if not, it’s not as handy as I had hoped.</p>\n<h2>The Notifications</h2>\n<p>The one good area of the watch so far has been the notifications. For the most part the notifications I get on the watch are completely useless. But, because they come in on the watch, where you can do nothing with them for the most part, I dismiss them and I don’t think about them.</p>\n<p>That means that I’ve actually used my phone much less. So despite the distraction of the notifications coming in and buzzing my wrist, I do tend to stay away from my iPhone more, which means less time wasted on YouTube and whatnot, which often happened whenever I picked it up to check an email.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>It’s only been a week. I think that I will continue to give it a try. I don’t think that everyone who touts this thing as a health or fitness gadget really knows what they’re talking about. I hope that no one really takes this data seriously, because so far, I can’t see where it is anywhere near accurate.</p>\n<p>That being said, I still kind of like it. It may be useless, but in typical Apple fashion, the hardware is excellent and I have found I enjoy having a clock with a timer on my wrist. I think I may try the pomodoro technique again, so this might help with that.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to receive these blog posts a week early, you can support me on Patreon Here</p>\n<p>I hope everyone has a nice week,</p>\n<p>Matt</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>I'm a nerd.</p>\n<p>Kind of obvious, of course, but there is no place where my nerd-dom shines more as when I start talking about file managers.</p>\n<p>It's ridiculous, really. I have spend dozens of hours over the last two years looking for the 'perfect' file manager. Thunar didn't have dual pane mode, so I switched to Nemo, which had that feature. Nemo didn't remember close state, so I switched to Dolphin. That was too bloated with dependencies, so I switched to Krusader.</p>\n<p>Honestly the only file manager I haven't spent a lot of time in during the last couple of years is Nautilus, which I can't stand. I think it smells too much like Gnome.</p>\n<p>Krusader is my favorite Linux app that I've ever used. That's a shocking thing to even think about, really. A File Manager? Truly?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thelinuxcast.org/img/krusader.png\"><img src=\"https://thelinuxcast.org/img/krusader.png\" alt=\"Krusader\" /></a></p>\n<p>Yes. I'm foolishly enamored with Krusader. It has everything I ever wanted in a File manager. Good tab management. Remembers close state (i.e. all my tabs open up when I restart the app). Is dual pane by default. Has a ton of awesome features like comparing two directories and merging them. And so much more.</p>\n<p>Now, obviously it has it's own problems. Dependencies are kind of a mess. Image preview isn't enabled by default and actually requires a dependency. It also grabs focus for whatever reason sometimes and won't let go unless you click on another app. That's odd. But not a deal breaker.</p>\n<p>I've developed a system now that I keep all of my video projects, work projects open in tabs between the two panes, and just rely on them staying there until I'm done. It's messy by anyone's standards, but I love it. It had made it actually easier for me to keep track of the things I'm working on. Definitely not the way you should do it, but it works for me.</p>\n<p>It has led to something else, though. I've found myself using tabs other places much more than I used to. I used to be a 4 or 5 tab guy in Firefox. Now I have dozens and have adopted Tab Groups as my next new favorite thing. So I have way more tabs open all the time. Also uses a ton of memory. Right now I'm over 10GB used, which is nuts.</p>\n<p>So, yeah. I love Krusader. I thought about making another video about it, but decided that no one really cares about this type of thing. Maybe I might do it anyway.</p>\n<p>Hope everyone's week is going well,</p>\n",
